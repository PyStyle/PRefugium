# PRefugium

Hi,
welcome to the OS P/Refugium Meta-Interface!

This my final project of the course "Software, Artware, Nowhere", taught by Jonathan Reus and Rosa Menkmann
at Leuphana University/HMS in 2017.

Download the zip file, open your Terminal and run prefugium.py at the command line.

Please keep in mind, to run this program proper you will need:

PyQt5.QtWidgets
PyQt5.QtCore
PyQt5.QtGui
PyQt5.QtMultimedia

ui_camera
ui_imagesettings
ui_videosettings


Feel free to copy and download my code, have fun in P/Refugium!
